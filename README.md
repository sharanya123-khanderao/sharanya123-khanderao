I've done my bachelor's in electrical and electronics engineering. My interest in data science began during an internship at Iniesta Web Tech Solutions, where I worked as a Data Scientist, python deleveloper. This experience exposed me to real-world data challenges and provided me with hands-on experience in leveraging data to make informed decisions.
