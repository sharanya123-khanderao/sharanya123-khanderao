- I'm Sharanya Khanderao, a driven and analytical data science professional with a Master’s in Data Science from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) and a Bachelor's in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Osmania University. My journey into data began during an internship at Iniesta Web Tech Solutions, where I worked on real-world data problems as a Data Scientist. Since then, I've deepened my expertise through roles in data analysis, full-stack development, and teaching assistance, gaining hands-on experience across the data science pipeline—from data wrangling and modeling to deployment and dashboard creation. My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, Django, React, TensorFlow, AWS, and Tableau. I’m passionate about transforming complex data into actionable insights that drive decision-making and innovation—especially in healthcare, public safety, and operational efficiency. I'm now actively exploring full-time opportunities where I can continue leveraging data to make a meaningful impact. Let’s connect!
